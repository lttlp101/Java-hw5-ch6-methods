## Description

#### Chapter 6 - Methods

This Java program include the following methods:
1. A method that calculates the area of a triangle given the base and height of the triangle.
<br> * double calculateTriangleArea(double base, double height)

2. A method that generates a random number between 1 and 20.
<br> * int roll1d20()

3. A method that calculates the distance between two points using the Pythagorean theorem
and the Math.pow() method. 
<br> distance = ((x2−x1)^2+(y2−y1)^2) ^ 0.5
<br> * double distance(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2)

4. A method that calls each of the methods above two times each to demonstrate that they all work correctly.
